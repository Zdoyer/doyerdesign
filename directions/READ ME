-I want on all the pages for the source bar to be centered under the  header photo
-on page one, I want the “what is cyber security” to be larger than the rest of the text and  for it to be underlined with a bullet to the left centered. 
-I want the rest of the text to be to be in the same format as below. Normal unordered list and bulleted in the center. 

PAGE 2
-For page two, I want the “common cyber threats” to be floated to the left with a boarder 
-On page two, I also want the “cybersecurity best practice” to be floated to the right with a boarder as well. 
-Maybe 5px boarder for both with rounded edges, make the boarder color black.
-I want the “hacked” photo to be placed below the floated images full width across the screen 

PAGE 3
-I would like the “Cybersecurity Certifications & Careers” to be floated to the right with the photo “glasses” to be floated to the left. I would like the photo to be the same width and height as the text

-For “careers in cybersecurity” I would like that section floated to the left under the “glasses” photo and I would like the photo “coding” floated to the right of this text. 

-I want both of these sections and photos to be the same width to create symmetry on the page. 

For the footer, I want it to be #71667A background color with white text
